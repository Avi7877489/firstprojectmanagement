#Reflection on Project Management Tools:
-GitHub's project management tools, such as milestones, issues, and project boards, are incredibly effective for enhancing team collaboration and keeping projects organized
-Issues are vital for tracking bugs, feature requests, and tasks. 
-The project board acts as a visual guide
